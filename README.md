Bayesian Logistic Regresion with Hybrid/Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
=======================
bayesLogisticRegression

This code implements Bayesian logistic regression using Hybrid/Hamiltonian Monte Carlo in Torch7/Lua.

The ripley data set is used as a test case. 
To run: torch logisticRegression.lua

I based this implementation on a previous implementation in Matlab, which can be found here: http://www.shakirm.com/code/EFLVM/html/demo_BayesLogReg.html
